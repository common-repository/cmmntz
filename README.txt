The next generation of comments. CMMNTZ rebuilt Online Comments & Community Engagement from the ground up. Differentiate your blog with better commenting by giving your Community never before seen ways to comment.

== Description ==

Comments are the core way for your Community to engage, & engaged users are much more likely to click on advertising, become a subscriber, or just come back on a regular basis.  Unfortunately, many blogs struggle just to be found & can’t dedicate the resources to have truly engaged Communities.  Add on the fact that most Online Commenting widgets are essentially identical & it’s no wonder that many blogs face an uphill battle.
